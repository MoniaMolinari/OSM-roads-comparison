# GRASS scripts
This folder contains 3 Python modules for [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) aimed at performing a geometrical comparison between two road network datasets: one from the [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](http://openstreetmap.org) project and one from an authoritative source:
* [v.osm.precomp](https://github.com/MoniaMolinari/OSM-roads-comparison/blob/master/GRASS-scripts/v.osm.precomp) (Step 1) performs a preliminary comparison of the two datasets, computes global statistics and performs a sensitivity analysis to help users choosing a suitable value of the buffer parameter, which is key in Step 2
* [v.osm.preproc](https://github.com/MoniaMolinari/OSM-roads-comparison/blob/master/GRASS-scripts/v.osm.preproc) (Step 2) performs a geometric preprocessing of the OSM road network dataset to extract its subset representing the same road features of the authoritative dataset
* [v.osm.acc](https://github.com/MoniaMolinari/OSM-roads-comparison/blob/master/GRASS-scripts/v.osm.acc) (Step 3) evaluates the spatial accuracy of the OSM subset extracted in Step 2 using a grid-based approach

The modules are independent, however users are suggested to apply them subsequently to maximize the effectiveness of the procedure.

## Installation
We will soon post the installation instructions here.
